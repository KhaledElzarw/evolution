# Legacy and Quarantine Candidate Inventory

This inventory records files that may be legacy, duplicated, experimental, or
runtime/archive material. It does not authorize deletion, movement, import
changes, or behavior changes.

Default status for every item is **Needs confirmation**. Do not claim a file is
unused until references, tests, operator workflows, and runtime behavior have
been checked.

## Summary

Candidate groups:

- Historical or experimental grid engines.
- Removed Telegram control bot.
- Removed trend-specific engine path.
- Removed advisor process and flexy grid mode.
- Backup files matching `*.bak` or `*.bak_*`.
- `accounting_archive_*` folders.
- Runtime JSON/JSONL archives and mirrors.

## grid_engine_honest.py

Status: **Removed deprecated research/backtest replay script**

1. Former path: `grid_engine_honest.py`
2. Why removed: Root-level engine-like module with grid/accounting classes
   and helper names that overlap with the main engine.
3. Evidence of duplication or runtime/archive nature:
   - Defines `PaperAccount`, `GridOrder`, and `GridState`.
   - Defines helpers such as `_ema`, `_atr`, `_spacing_for_mode`,
     `_build_grid_orders`, and `_fill_order_paper`.
   - Similar concepts also exist in the main engine path.
   - Generated `grid_honest_replay.json` and
     `grid_honest_replay_equity.json`; these remain ignored as legacy local
     outputs if old copies exist.
   - No supported README/OPERATIONS invocation found.
   - Performed replay work at import time.
   - Read a hardcoded local feather data path.
   - Wrote replay outputs and printed a result.
4. Removal safety:
   - No supported core imports or orchestrator services referenced the script.
   - Removal does not touch engine strategy, order execution, dashboard, SQLite,
     AI sidecar, or migration behavior.
5. Required checks after removal:
   - Full pytest suite.
   - Compileall.
   - Ruff.

## grid_engine_honest_v2.py

Status: **Removed deprecated research/backtest replay script**

1. Former path: `grid_engine_honest_v2.py`
2. Why removed: Versioned root-level engine-like module suggests an
   experiment or replacement candidate.
3. Evidence of duplication or runtime/archive nature:
   - Defines `PaperAccount`, `GridOrder`, and `GridState`.
   - Defines `_ema`, `_atr`, `_build_grid_orders`, and `_fill`.
   - Overlaps conceptually with `grid_engine_honest.py` and `engine.py`.
   - Generated `grid_honest_replay_v2.json`; this remains ignored as a legacy
     local output if old copies exist.
   - No supported README/OPERATIONS invocation found.
   - Performed replay work at import time.
   - Read a hardcoded local feather data path.
   - Wrote replay output and printed a result.
4. Removal safety:
   - No supported core imports or orchestrator services referenced the script.
   - Removal does not touch engine strategy, order execution, dashboard, SQLite,
     AI sidecar, or migration behavior.
5. Required checks after removal:
   - Full pytest suite.
   - Compileall.
   - Ruff.

## control_bot.py

Status: **Removed deprecated Telegram operator control surface**

1. Former path: `control_bot.py`
2. Why removed: Deprecated non-core operator control surface that depended on
   `python-telegram-bot`.
3. Evidence of removal safety:
   - No preserved core module imported `control_bot`.
   - `dashboard_orchestrator.py` did not start it.
   - Remaining Telegram notification helpers use direct HTTPS calls through
     `requests`.
4. Required checks after removal:
   - Full pytest suite.
   - Coverage run and report.
   - Ruff.
   - Compileall.

## engine_trend.py

Status: **Removed deprecated alternate engine workflow**

1. Former path: `engine_trend.py`
2. Why removed: Alternate engine entry point in the repository root.
3. Evidence of duplication or runtime/archive nature:
   - Defines engine-like runtime classes and functions such as `PaperAccount`,
     `Position`, `Stats`, `_write_status`, `_append_trade`, `_ema`, `_atr`, and
     `main`.
   - Writes or references trend-specific runtime artifacts such as
     `engine_trend.log`.
   - Former Telegram control bot commands read and wrote trend-specific
     state/status/trade files before the control bot was removed.
   - Importing the module loaded local environment variables.
   - Runtime execution was guarded by `main`.
4. Removal status:
   - Source file has been removed as a deprecated non-core workflow.
   - No current service manager or core module should import or invoke it.
   - Trend-specific runtime artifacts may still exist in local workspaces and
     remain ignored as legacy local artifacts.
5. Follow-up cleanup:
   - Remove stale current-runtime wording from docs.
   - Keep `.gitignore` patterns for trend runtime artifacts in place.
6. Required checks for documentation cleanup:
   - Full pytest suite.
   - Compileall.
   - Ruff.

## advisor.py

Status: **Removed deprecated advisor/flexy workflow**

1. Former path: `advisor.py`
2. Why removed: Separate root-level process with deterministic advisor
   behavior and its own log path.
3. Evidence of duplication or runtime/archive nature:
   - Defines market helpers such as `_ema`, `_atr`, `_advisor_light`,
     `_advisor_full`, and `_fetch_market`.
   - Wrote `advisor.log`; old copies may still exist as ignored runtime
     artifacts.
   - Control text referenced an advisor choosing mode for `flexy`.
   - Main engine previously accepted `gridMode=flexy`.
   - Importing the module loaded local environment variables.
   - Runtime execution was guarded by `main`.
4. Removal status:
   - Source file has been removed as a deprecated non-core workflow.
   - No current service manager or core module should import or invoke it.
   - `gridMode=flexy` is no longer supported; supported grid modes are
     `scalpy` and `fatty`.
   - Engine and dashboard validation fail closed for unsupported grid modes.
   - Old `advisor.log` files remain ignored as legacy local artifacts.
5. Required checks after removal:
   - Full pytest suite.
   - Coverage run and report.
   - Ruff.
   - Compileall.

## migrate_to_sqlite.py

Status: **Active/manual migration tool; do-not-move-yet**

1. Current path: `migrate_to_sqlite.py`
2. Why inventoried: Root-level manual command that reads runtime JSON/JSONL
   mirrors and writes the SQLite runtime store.
3. Evidence of active/manual ownership:
   - Documented in `OPERATIONS.md` as an optional/manual storage migration or
     backfill command.
   - Listed in `docs/architecture.md` as the migration/backfill entry point.
   - Covered by `tests/test_migrate_to_sqlite.py`.
   - Importing the module does not run migration; execution is guarded by
     `main`.
4. Risk if moved:
   - Would break the documented operator command unless wrappers, docs, and
     tests are updated together.
5. Proposed future action:
   - Keep in place until migration commands are intentionally reorganized.
   - Preserve current command compatibility or provide an explicit replacement
     before any move.
6. Required tests before moving:
   - Full pytest suite.
   - Compileall.
   - SQLite migration tests.
   - Manual operator confirmation that documented migration/backfill commands
     have been updated.

## Backup Files Matching `*.bak` or `*.bak_*`

Status: **Needs confirmation for local cleanup; do not track**

1. Current path:
   - `trades.jsonl.bak_pre_resume_cleanup`
   - `trades.jsonl.bak_pre_dedupe`
   - `dashboard_server.py.bak_20260501_080913`
   - `engine.py.bak_20260501_080913`
   - Future files matching `*.bak` or `*.bak_*`
2. Why suspicious: Backup suffixes indicate local snapshots rather than source.
3. Evidence of duplication or runtime/archive nature:
   - The patterns are ignored by `.gitignore`.
   - Some names point to old copies of source files.
   - Some names point to archived runtime trade logs.
4. Risk if moved:
   - Usually low for source control because ignored backups are not tracked.
   - Operational risk exists if an operator expects the local backup for manual
     rollback or audit.
5. How to confirm usage:
   - Run `find . -maxdepth 3 \( -name '*.bak' -o -name '*.bak_*' \) -print`.
   - Confirm whether any file is intentionally retained for audit or rollback.
   - Check that no scripts reference a specific backup filename.
6. Proposed future action:
   - Keep ignored and out of Git.
   - Move to private local backup storage if retention is required.
   - Delete locally only after operator confirmation; do not delete as part of
     modernization commits.
7. Required tests before moving:
   - Full pytest suite if moving source-like backups out of the repo tree.
   - No runtime tests are required for ignored backups unless a script references
     them.
   - Operator confirmation for any retained audit backup.

## `accounting_archive_*` Folders

Status: **Needs confirmation for local cleanup; do not track**

1. Current path:
   - `accounting_archive_2026-04-30/`
   - Future folders matching `accounting_archive_*`
2. Why suspicious: Date-stamped archive directory containing runtime state.
3. Evidence of duplication or runtime/archive nature:
   - The observed folder contains runtime files such as `runtime_state.json`,
     `trades.jsonl`, `engine_status.json`, and `cumulative.json`.
   - The folder is ignored by Git as an untracked runtime/archive artifact.
4. Risk if moved:
   - May remove local rollback/audit material.
   - May affect manual accounting reconciliation if operators still need it.
5. How to confirm usage:
   - List filenames only; do not print values from archive contents.
   - Ask operators whether the archive is needed for accounting, incident
     review, or migration rollback.
   - Check scripts for references to `accounting_archive_`.
6. Proposed future action:
   - Keep out of Git.
   - Move to private backup storage if retention is required.
   - Clean locally only after explicit operator approval.
7. Required tests before moving:
   - No application behavior tests are required for purely local archive
     movement.
   - Run full pytest suite if scripts or migration workflows are adjusted later.
   - Confirm SQLite and JSON migration rollback workflows before removing any
     archive needed for recovery.

## Runtime JSON/JSONL Archives and Mirrors

Status: **Runtime artifacts must stay out of Git; legacy trend mirrors remain ignored**

1. Current path:
   - `state.json`
   - `state_trend.json`
   - `runtime_state.json`
   - `engine_status.json`
   - `engine_status_trend.json`
   - `cumulative.json`
   - `cumulative_trend.json`
   - `trades.jsonl`
   - `trades_trend.jsonl`
   - `ai_signal.json`
   - `ai_decisions.jsonl`
   - `ai_memory.json`
   - `dashboard_history.json`
   - `*.json.bak*`
   - `*.jsonl.bak*`
2. Why suspicious: These are generated runtime state, compatibility mirrors, or
   archives of operational data.
3. Evidence of duplication or runtime/archive nature:
   - They are ignored by `.gitignore`.
   - The architecture and operations docs identify SQLite as the canonical
     local runtime store, with JSON/JSONL files retained as compatibility
     mirrors.
   - JSONL trade logs and AI logs may contain operational history.
4. Risk if moved:
   - Moving active runtime files can break local services if paths are still
     expected by wrappers, dashboard code, engine code, or migration scripts.
   - Moving archives can remove operator recovery context.
5. How to confirm usage:
   - Run `rg "state.json|runtime_state.json|engine_status.json|trades.jsonl|ai_signal.json|ai_decisions.jsonl|ai_memory.json|dashboard_history.json" .`.
   - Confirm active runtime paths in code before moving anything.
   - Confirm operator backup and recovery requirements.
6. Proposed future action:
   - Keep active runtime files ignored and local-only.
   - Later separate runtime directories from source only with explicit path
     compatibility and migration planning.
   - Add tests before changing any path used by runtime code.
7. Required tests before moving:
   - Full pytest suite.
   - Compileall.
   - Dashboard payload tests.
   - Engine runtime snapshot tests.
   - SQLite migration tests.
   - Manual smoke check for orchestrator, dashboard, and engine status.

## Runtime Cache: dashboard_intelligence.json

Status: **Classified as generated runtime cache.** See
[Dashboard Intelligence Cache Classification](dashboard-intelligence-classification.md).

1. Current path: `dashboard_intelligence.json`
2. Why suspicious: JSON snapshot-style filename in the repository root.
3. Evidence of duplication or runtime/archive nature:
   - The file is not tracked and is ignored by `.gitignore`.
   - The filename suggests cached dashboard intelligence or generated state.
   - Similar runtime JSON files are ignored elsewhere.
4. Risk if moved:
   - May break dashboard boot or deterministic fallback behavior if the file is
     intentionally a fixture or seed.
   - May remove a known-good cached intelligence payload used by operators.
5. How to confirm usage:
   - Run `rg "dashboard_intelligence" .`.
   - Determine whether it is a fixture, seed data, or runtime cache.
   - Check dashboard tests and startup behavior.
6. Proposed future action:
   - Keep ignored and local-only, preserving any local operator copy.
   - Move to ignored runtime storage only in a later explicit
     behavior-preserving commit.
   - If fixture/seed, rename or document its role in a future docs/test commit.
7. Required tests before moving:
   - Full pytest suite.
   - Dashboard server tests.
   - Manual dashboard boot check.
   - Confirmation that no deployment expects the root path.

## General Quarantine Criteria

A future quarantine move for remaining legacy files should require:

1. A clean working tree or intentional preservation branch/stash.
2. Reference search results.
3. Maintainer/operator confirmation for ambiguous files.
4. Characterization tests for any executable or importable code.
5. A dedicated commit that moves files without editing logic.
6. A rollback command and clear release note.

Until then, these files should remain in place.
