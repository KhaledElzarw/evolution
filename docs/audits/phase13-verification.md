# Phase 13 — Independent Verification Findings

Six fresh-context adversarial verifiers were run against the branch. None had
authored the code under review; each was instructed to **falsify** the author's
claims rather than confirm them, and to run real probes rather than read
summaries.

**Verifier completion is itself an honest caveat:** 2 of 6 completed fully; 4
terminated early on a session limit. Three of those four had already reported
partial signals, which were investigated manually and are recorded below. The
two areas with **no verification coverage** are named at the end — they are not
claimed as verified.

## Confirmed defects found and fixed

### V1 (CRITICAL) — Plugin sandbox escape: AST validator bypassable → RCE

**Found by:** plugin/broker security verifier (partial signal: "Confirmed
arbitrary file write (and full `os`/RCE)"), then reproduced manually.

`tradebot/infrastructure/adapters/plugins/validator.py`

The validator's deny-by-default claim was **false**. Two gaps combined:

1. `getattr`/`setattr`/`vars`/`dir`/`hasattr` were not in
   `FORBIDDEN_CALL_NAMES`, permitting **string-based attribute access**.
2. `FORBIDDEN_ATTRIBUTES` was a short hand-picked list; `__class__`,
   `__bases__`, `__mro__`, `__dict__` were all permitted.

Together these allow the classic escape, with **string concatenation defeating
even the listed names**:

```python
base = getattr(getattr((), "__cl"+"ass__"), "__ba"+"ses__")[0]
subs = getattr(base, "__sub"+"classes__")()
```

**Reproduced end-to-end:** a bundle containing this passed `validate_bundle()`
(`ok=True`) and, executed via `run_strategy_in_worker()`, reached **299
subclasses including `_wrap_close` and `catch_warnings`** — both standard
routes to `os`/`os.system`. On Windows the worker has no filesystem jail, so
this is arbitrary code execution with file write. This defeated the entire
Phase 5 security thesis.

**Fix:**
- `getattr`, `setattr`, `delattr`, `hasattr`, `vars`, `dir`, `locals` added to
  `FORBIDDEN_CALL_NAMES` (as calls *and* as bare-name aliases).
- **All** dunder attribute access rejected via `_DUNDER_RE` (`^__.*__$`) rather
  than a blocklist.
- Dunder **string literals** rejected.

The two rules are complementary and close the class: a runtime-built dunder
string is inert without `getattr`, and literal `.__class__` is caught by the
dunder rule.

**Verified:** all 8 escape vectors now rejected; all 12 built-ins remain clean
under the new rules (they use no reflection). Regressions:
`test_plugin_validator.py::test_reflection_escape_vectors_rejected` (13
vectors) and `::test_builtin_strategy_sources_have_no_reflection_constructs`.

### V2 (MODERATE) — `realized_pnl` ledger posting had the wrong value and inverted sign

**Found by:** accounting verifier (completed).

`tradebot/domain/ledger.py` — the SELL leg posted
`quote(cost_released - gross)`: a balancing plug that is the **gross** result,
**negated** and **fee-excluded**. It did not equal realized P&L.

Repro (BUY 0.1 @ 60000, SELL 0.1 @ 66000, 0.1% fees): posting **−594.00** vs
true realized **+587.40**. Systematic across partial sells.

This directly contradicted the module docstring's claim that "Net P&L is
derived from event postings". Latent — the only consumers read
`Wallet.realized_pnl` (which was always correct) — but any audit summing the
persisted `realized_pnl` account would reconstruct a wrong, sign-flipped
number.

**Fix:** the `realized_pnl` leg now carries the true net realized value
(gain credited negative, loss debited positive) with `base_asset` as the
balancing contra leg. Postings still sum to zero. Regressions:
`test_ledger.py::test_realized_pnl_posting_carries_true_net_realized`,
`::test_realized_pnl_posting_correct_across_partial_sells`,
`::test_loss_making_sell_posts_a_debit`.

### V3 (LOW/MEDIUM) — Body-size limit bypassable by omitting Content-Length

**Found by:** API security verifier (completed).

`tradebot/api/app.py` — the 1 MiB guard only ran `if content-length` was
present. A chunked/streamed request omits it, skipping the check entirely:
an unauthenticated memory-DoS vector.

**Fix:** the declared length is still rejected cheaply, but when absent on
POST/PUT/PATCH the real body is measured against the cap. Malformed
Content-Length is now rejected too. Regression:
`test_api.py::test_oversized_body_rejected_without_content_length`.

### V4 (LOW) — Early 413 response carried no security headers

`tradebot/api/app.py` — headers were applied only after `call_next`, so the
early 413 return bypassed them. **Fix:** `_too_large()` now emits
`SECURITY_HEADERS`. Regression:
`test_api.py::test_413_response_carries_security_headers`.

### V5 (FUNCTIONAL) — `default_probe` made real `stop`/`status` impossible

**Found by:** API security verifier (noted as a functional, fail-safe defect).

`tradebot/operations/process_identity.py` — `default_probe` returns empty
`service`/`instance_id`/`nonce` (the OS cannot know them), but `verify()` used
the strict `matches()`, which compares all seven fields. Against a real probe
it could **never** succeed: production `stop`/`status` would always report a
mismatch and refuse to act.

**Fix:** separated the concepts. `matches_live()` compares only OS-observable
fields (pid, start_time, executable, command) — which are what actually defeat
PID reuse — and `verify()`/`cmd_status`/`cmd_start` now use it. `matches()`
remains the strict full comparison. `service`/`instance_id`/`nonce` authenticate
the PID *file* against the deployment; copying them from the file into the probe
would have been circular and proved nothing. Regressions:
`test_operations.py::test_os_only_probe_can_verify_a_real_process`,
`::test_matches_live_still_defeats_pid_reuse` (anti-reuse preserved),
`::test_status_reports_running_with_os_only_probe`.

### V6 (LOW) — Improper `# pragma: no cover` on a testable guard

`tradebot/domain/money.py:44` — the float-rejection guard was marked
`pragma: no cover` despite being trivially testable, violating the pragma
policy. **Fix:** pragma removed; covered by
`test_operations.py::test_money_rejects_float_at_the_boundary`.

## Verifier findings assessed and NOT actioned

- **`origin_allowed(None) == True`** (absent Origin). Not a CSRF hole: the same
  guard still requires a Bearer token a cross-site attacker cannot supply.
  Intentional (curl/same-origin support). Documented, not changed.
- **`apply_fee` docstring vs behaviour** — docstring says fees round "in the
  exchange's favour"; implementation uses `ROUND_HALF_UP`. Cosmetic; not
  exploitable through execution because `MIN_NOTIONAL=5.00` keeps live fees
  above the rounding floor. Left as a documentation nit.
- **`safeUrl` permits any external `https:` URL** — would be an open-redirect
  *if wired to server data*, but it is not currently invoked on live data.
  Noted as a latent hazard for whoever wires it up.
- **Transaction-id ordering** depends on wallet iteration order; no
  accounting-relevant order dependence exists (all monetary results are keyed
  per wallet/intent/snapshot).

## Areas with NO verification coverage (not claimed as verified)

The evolution-rules and database/migration verifiers both terminated on the
session limit before producing findings.

- **Evolution / replacement / promotion rule fidelity** — covered only by the
  author's own tests. The elimination-count, ceil/floor allocation, parent
  eligibility, ban-reuse and crash-injection rules are **unverified by an
  independent reviewer**.
- **Database schema / migration atomicity** — likewise unverified. The DB
  verifier's one partial signal, *"Confirmed money precision loss"*, was **not
  reproduced or resolved** and remains an open lead worth chasing: money columns
  should be text/`Numeric`, never `REAL`.

These two gaps, plus the known Phase 3 legacy-import gap and the 97%-not-100%
coverage position, are the honest outstanding risks on this branch.
