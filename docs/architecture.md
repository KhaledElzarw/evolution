# Tradebot Architecture

This document maps the current architecture before any structural refactor. It
is descriptive, not prescriptive runtime behavior.

## Current Architecture Overview

The repository is currently organized as a set of root-level Python modules
that share local runtime files, SQLite persistence, dashboard endpoints,
optional Telegram notifications, and optional AI review flows.

The main operating shape is:

- `engine.py` owns the trading loop and engine runtime state.
- `sqlite_store.py` owns the canonical local SQLite store.
- JSON and JSONL files remain compatibility mirrors for legacy/runtime flows.
- `dashboard_server.py`, `dashboard_routes.py`, and dashboard static assets
  expose monitoring and selected control surfaces.
- Retained engine helpers can send optional Telegram
  notifications through direct HTTPS calls.
- `ai_sidecar.py` produces optional AI decisions and review context.
- Wrapper scripts and `dashboard_orchestrator.py` start, stop, and inspect
  local services.

## Main Entry Points

- `bot.py`: Binance REST smoke check.
- `engine.py`: trading engine entry point.
- `dashboard_server.py`: dashboard server entry point.
- `ai_sidecar.py`: AI sidecar entry point.
- `ai_playground.py`: one-off AI review helper.
- `dashboard_orchestrator.py`: grouped service start/stop/status commands.
- `run_engine_detached.py`: detached engine wrapper.
- `run_dashboard_detached.py`: detached dashboard wrapper.
- `run_ai_sidecar_detached.py`: detached AI sidecar wrapper.
- `migrate_to_sqlite.py`: migration/backfill into the SQLite runtime store.

## Core Engine Responsibilities

`engine.py` is responsible for:

- Reading environment and runtime configuration.
- Maintaining the engine main loop.
- Reading market/account inputs through existing adapters.
- Managing grid state and paper/testnet trading state.
- Reading optional AI signal inputs.
- Applying existing strategy and risk decision logic.
- Writing status, runtime state, and event outputs.
- Recording trade/accounting events through local persistence paths.

The engine is the highest-risk module because it is closest to trading
decisions and exchange interaction. Refactors around this module must preserve
behavior unless a later task explicitly authorizes a behavior change.

## Persistence Model

### SQLite Canonical Store

SQLite is the canonical local runtime store. The default database file is
`tradebot.sqlite3`, with WAL and SHM sidecar files created by SQLite when WAL
mode is active.

`sqlite_store.py` centralizes current SQLite helpers for snapshots, events,
history, AI strategy records, and related runtime persistence.

### JSON Compatibility Mirrors

JSON and JSONL files remain compatibility mirrors for legacy/runtime flows and
simple operator inspection. They are runtime artifacts, not source files.

Current examples include:

- `state.json`
- `runtime_state.json`
- `engine_status.json`
- `cumulative.json`
- `trades.jsonl`
- `ai_signal.json`
- `ai_decisions.jsonl`
- `ai_memory.json`
- `dashboard_history.json`

Legacy trend mirrors such as `state_trend.json`, `engine_status_trend.json`,
`cumulative_trend.json`, and `trades_trend.jsonl` may exist in old local
workspaces and remain ignored as local artifacts, but the removed trend engine
is not part of the current runtime architecture.

Future refactors should reduce mixed source/runtime concerns carefully, but not
by changing persistence behavior in the same commit as structural movement.

## Dashboard and Control Surface Responsibilities

The dashboard stack is responsible for:

- Serving the browser dashboard.
- Rendering initial dashboard HTML.
- Exposing read endpoints for status, runtime, market, history, orders, and AI
  context.
- Exposing protected mutation endpoints for selected controls/configuration.
- Streaming runtime updates through SSE.
- Streaming or serving chart data through WebSocket and polling fallbacks.
- Coordinating dashboard-specific state normalization and payload contracts.

Current dashboard-related files include:

- `dashboard_server.py`
- `dashboard_routes.py`
- `dashboard_contracts.py`
- `dashboard_data.py`
- `dashboard_orchestrator.py`
- `dashboard/static/dashboard.v1.js`
- `dashboard/static/dashboard.v1.css`

Dashboard refactors must avoid changing the control contract or exposing
mutation endpoints without token controls.

## AI Sidecar Responsibilities

The AI sidecar is responsible for:

- Building AI prompt payloads from current runtime context.
- Loading prompt templates.
- Calling local or OpenAI-compatible AI endpoints when enabled.
- Producing AI reports and portfolio decisions through schema validation.
- Writing current AI signal/runtime outputs.
- Maintaining AI decision, memory, and review artifacts.

AI output must remain advisory unless existing engine configuration explicitly
uses it. Refactors should not silently change AI enablement, stale-signal
handling, model selection, prompt semantics, or engine consumption behavior.

## Optional Telegram Notification Responsibilities

Current Telegram behavior is limited to retained notification helpers in
`engine.py`. These helpers are responsible for:

- Sending selected runtime notifications when `TELEGRAM_CONTROL_BOT_TOKEN` and
  local runtime state provide a destination chat.
- Avoiding the `python-telegram-bot` runtime dependency.
- Remaining unchanged until notification ownership is decided in a later branch.

The deprecated advisor entry point has been removed. Old `advisor.log` files may
still exist in local workspaces and should remain ignored as runtime artifacts.

Telegram tokens are sensitive local configuration and belong outside Git.

## Runtime Artifacts and Where They Should Live

Runtime artifacts should live in the local runtime environment, not in source
control. In production-like operation, configure paths so durable runtime files
are stored in a private local volume or deployment-managed data directory.

Local-only runtime artifacts include:

- `.env`
- `.env.*`
- `tradebot.sqlite3`
- `*.sqlite3-wal`
- `*.sqlite3-shm`
- `*.log`
- `*.pid`
- `*.nohup.out`
- JSON and JSONL runtime mirrors.
- `.venv`
- `__pycache__`
- `.pytest_cache`

The repository should only track placeholder examples, source code, tests,
documentation, and CI/configuration files that do not contain secrets or live
runtime data.

## Known Architecture Debt

Current known debt:

- Large root modules combine orchestration, data shaping, runtime I/O, and
  business behavior.
- Some helper functions are duplicated across engine, dashboard, sidecar, and
  wrapper modules.
- Source files and runtime files historically lived side by side in the repo
  root, which increases accidental tracking risk.
- Dashboard server responsibilities are broad.
- AI prompt, schema, memory, and sidecar responsibilities are still closely
  coupled.
- Legacy Baserow sync/export scripts have been removed; SQLite is the supported
  local runtime store.
- Service wrappers and orchestration have overlapping process-management
  concerns.

These are structural concerns, not authorization to change behavior.

## Future Target Structure

A future structure may separate source, tests, documentation, and runtime
artifacts more clearly. One possible target is:

```text
.
|-- src/tradebot/
|   |-- engine/
|   |-- dashboard/
|   |-- ai/
|   |-- persistence/
|   |-- integrations/
|   `-- runtime/
|-- tests/
|-- docs/
|-- scripts/
|-- requirements.txt
|-- requirements-dev.txt
`-- .env.example
```

This is a direction for future planning only. A `src/` migration should not
happen until import boundaries, entry points, packaging, runtime paths, and
deployment/service wrappers are confirmed.

## Refactor Safety Principles

- One commit should have one purpose.
- Prefer documentation, tests, and CI before structural moves.
- Preserve current behavior unless a task explicitly asks for a behavior
  change.
- Add characterization tests before moving sensitive behavior.
- Keep trading strategy behavior and order execution behavior isolated from
  hygiene refactors.
- Avoid mixing file moves with logic edits.
- Avoid changing runtime file paths and process behavior in the same commit.
- Keep secrets and runtime artifacts out of diffs, logs, tests, and examples.
- Validate with tests and compile checks before committing.

## Do-Not-Touch-Yet List

Do not change these areas during foundation modernization unless a later task
explicitly authorizes it:

- Trading strategy behavior.
- Order execution behavior.
- Engine main loop.
- `src/` migration.
- Legacy engine moves until confirmed.
- Exchange API semantics.
- AI decision semantics consumed by the engine.
- Dashboard mutation/control contract.
- Runtime persistence semantics.
- Live credential handling beyond documentation and guardrails.
